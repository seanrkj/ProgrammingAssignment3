# ProgrammingAssignment - Getting and Cleaning Data Project
This code will result in a tidy data set of the given data.

The original data set can be found here: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

`CodeBook.md` describes the variables, data, and work that was performed.

`Run_Analysis.R` contains all the code to perform the data cleaning.


The final output data is named TidyData.txt.
